# C++ Keyboard and Date

Personal project for making it easy to handle inputs in C++ as well as date handling.
Feel free to use the code, credits are greatly appreciated.

All feedback welcome.

Huge thanks to everyone on stackoverflow for asking and answering questions, helped a lot in getting answers to issues I've faced.
Should there be any code that you feel is similar or belongs to someone/you, and provided there's proof,
please do let me know and I'll glady credit or remove the code accordingly.
